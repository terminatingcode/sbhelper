# SBHelper - the NYT Spelling Bee Helper

The SBHelper is a Firefox web extension that dynamically adds hints for the [New York Times Spelling Bee game](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee).

The NYT Spelling Bee always provides a solution key of the length of words as well as the starting letter in a numerical grid. The SBHelper scrapes the daily puzzle's hints page for the solution key and calculates the words missing from the hints grid and counts down to full success!

Everytime you enter a new word, the helper recalculates the hints and removes hints as soon as they are no longer needed.

Don't want to see the hints until you reach 'Genius' level? It's behind a button. Don't use the hints until you need them.
